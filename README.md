# WebcamFaceDetection

This is a small project done for understanding of OpenCV library. 

This takes a video from webcam or a video file and detects face in real time. This was implemented using Haar-Cascades using provided trained data in OpenCV repository. Purpose of this project was to understand Face Detection for the next step in the process that is Face Recognition.
